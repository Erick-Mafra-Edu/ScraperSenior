            Checklist inicial para Carga Inicial de filiais em operação
            Para facilitar a utilização da carga inicial de filiais em operação, sugerimos utilizar este checklist.
            
                Importante
                
                Para otimizar a carga rápida de produtos do PDV (onde o tempo da carga de produtos é de, aproximadamente, um minuto em bases com 260 mil produtos), torna-se necessário configurar a propriedade base.ip, do arquivo conexoes.properties, contido no server do Retaguarda com o IP da máquina.
                Caso seja configurado o localhost ou o nome da máquina (host), a otimização não funcionará. Portanto, deve-se configurar o IP.
                Exemplo 1:
                    
                        
                            Incorreto: localhost
                            Correto: base.ip = 127.0.0.1
                        
                    
                
                Exemplo 2:
                    
                        
                            Incorreto: lojaserver
                            Correto: base.ip = 10.1.28.60
                        
                    
                
                Também torna-se necessário configurar o arquivo pghba.conf, presente no diretório de instalação do Postgres, para permitir acesso remoto (saiba como liberar o acesso remoto). Isso deve ser realizado na estação onde foi instalado o Integrador Retaguarda.
